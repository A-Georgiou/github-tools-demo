User requested a Python script implementing the Goldbach conjecture, similar in style to collatz_conjecture.py. I drafted and saved the issue, and the user confirmed it was saved at #2. User then asked me to create a pull request to solve the issue, and I initiated a PR (https://github.com/A-Georgiou/github-tools-demo/pull/3) with a WIP Goldbach conjecture script. User asked if there were any obvious bugs. I offered to fetch and review the code. User requested to make note of this conversation on the issue.
